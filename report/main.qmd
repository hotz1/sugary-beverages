# Introduction

Strong evidence has linked habitual intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) with weight gain and a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer [@Malik2022]. Multiple policy interventions to inhibit consumption of SSBs have been proposed [@Krieger2021], including taxation of SSBs, limiting access to SSBs in schools and healthcare facilities, and adding informative package labelling. As policymakers create potential interventions to limit SSB consumption, there is a need for data-driven methods of determining their efficacy.

This study aims to evaluate two groups of interventions which intend to shift consumers towards purchasing zero-calorie beverages instead of SSBs. Five separate interventions implemented at three hospitals are assessed. Three of these interventions utilize calorie-related messaging and the other two use price discounts to incentivize purchasing zero-calorie beverages.

The primary statistical question is whether these interventions are associated with differences in the average daily proportion of zero-calorie and sweetened beverage sales. Additional questions of interest include whether these interventions are equally effective at each hospital, and whether the effect of multiple simultaneous interventions is greater than the "sum of its parts".

# Data Description and Summaries

The data come from an interrupted time-series multi-site quasi-experimental study on sales of sweetened and zero-calorie beverages at three United States hospitals over a 30-week period. The data consists of 631 observations aggregated across the three sites. Each observation represents the daily sales of bottled beverages among multiple storefronts per site. Sales are automatically recorded by point of sale terminals in one site, and manually by store employees at remaining sites. Beverage sales are recorded every day from the beginning of the experiment until the final day, including weekends and holidays.

The data includes the following variables: the day of the experiment, the corresponding weekday, the site, and the ongoing intervention. The day variable is a positive integer. The latter three are categorical variables which respectively have seven, three, and nine levels. The data also contains the daily sales of bottled zero-calorie and sweetened beverages sold per site, and the total daily quantity of beverages sold per hospital. These are all non-negative integer values.Some observations also include the daily sales of 100% juice, orange juice, and sports drinks, which are also non-negative integer values. These quantities are only consistently recorded at *CHOP* and hardly recorded at the other hospitals.

Quantities of bottled zero-calorie and sugared beverages are missing in nine observations, each containing missing data for every sales-related column. Of these nine observations, seven occur in the final week of the study at *HF*, and two occur mid-study at *NS*. One mid-study observation from *HF* does not report the total quantity of beverages sold, though the quantity of bottled zero-calorie and sugared beverage sales are provided.

# Exploratory Analysis

@fig-2 shows side-by-side boxplots of the proportion of total sales coming from zero-calorie drinks for each site for each day of the week. They showed a similar proportion for each site and day of the week across sites, though one of the sites differed slightly and seemed to have more variable sales. Boxplots of total drinks sold showed one site had a lot more sales than the other two sites. Sales were also much lower for all sites on weekends compared to weekdays

A plot of the proportion of total sales coming from zero-calorie drinks over experiment day (@fig-1), shows the trends of sales across each site over day. There was some difference at the beginning of the experiment, but over time the average proportion seemed relatively stable, which is not expected. A scatterplot matrix comparing sugary, zero-calorie and total drink sales showed that they are all highly correlated with each other. The matrix also shows a positive linear relationship between zero-calorie, sugary and total sales.

A missing data plot (@fig-3) showed that orange juice, 100% juice and sports drinks had many missing observations. A missing data table (@fig-4) also showed many missing juice or sport drink sales, additionally showing that some sites did not record some of these sales at all. Since juice and sport drink sales are not of interest, and are inconsistently recorded, they are not included in the analysis. The missing data plot also showed nine observations had no sale measurements, which are also omitted.

# Formal Analysis

To answer the statistical questions, we formally assessed the relative effects of the interventions on the average daily proportion of both zero calorie and sugary beverage sales. The intervention groups had a statistically significant effect on the daily sales of both zero calorie and sugary beverage sales -- likelihood-ratio test (LRT) p \<0.0001 in both cases. The pairwise group comparisons for effect of interventions on the sales of zero-calorie beverages and sugared beverages are respectively shown in  @tbl-pairwise-zerocal and @tbl-pairwise-sugary.

In every case, the effects are represented as relative percentage changes, along with 95% confidence intervals for the effect size and Holm-adjusted p-values (Wald tests). Compared with the baseline periods, it is clear that the combined "discount and messaging" intervention was associated with an increase in the proportion of both zero-calorie and sugared beverage sales. The combined messaging strategy was also associated with an increase in the sales of zero-calorie beverages relative to other beverage options.

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-pairwise-zerocal
#| tbl-cap: "Pairwise group comparisons on average proportion of zero calorie sales."
readr::read_tsv(
  here::here("output/formal_analysis/pairwise_comparisons_ZeroCal.tsv"),
  show_col_types = FALSE
) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Adjusted p-value` = stringr::str_remove(
      `Adjusted p-value`, "p=|p<"
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    `Relative change (95% CI)` := `Relative change`
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-`Unadjusted p-value`) %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, width = "12em")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-pairwise-sugary
#| tbl-cap: "Pairwise group comparisons on average proportion sugary sales."
readr::read_tsv(
  here::here("output/formal_analysis/pairwise_comparisons_Sugary.tsv"),
  show_col_types = FALSE
) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    `Adjusted p-value` = stringr::str_remove(
      `Adjusted p-value`, "p=|p<"
    )
  ) %>%
  dplyr::rename(
    `Relative change (95% CI)` := `Relative change`
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-`Unadjusted p-value`) %>%
  kableExtra::kable() %>%
  kableExtra::column_spec(1, width = "12em")
```

Further, the intervention effects varied significantly across study sites, for both zero-calorie and sugary beverage sales (LRT p \<0.0001 in both cases). The variability in proportion of daily sales from each type of beverage can be visualized in @fig-adjusted-pred-zerocal and @fig-adjusted-pred-sugary.

# Conclusion

To accurately assess the efficacy of the five interventions, it is best to utilize statistical models which can assess how these interventions are associated with the sales of zero-calorie beverages and sugared beverages.

Therefore, we recommend fitting two Poisson GLMM models to respectively predict the daily sales of zero-calorie and sugared beverages, with each model incorporating an offset based on the total number of beverages sold on a given day. After creating these models, the relevant effects can be determined using the Likelihood Ratio Test.

## Missing Data

The plot below visualizes the number of missing observations per variable in the dataset. In addtion to the visualization below, a table of missing data is also provided which summarizes the total number and the percentage of missing observations for each variable across the three different sites.

miss_plot <- vis_miss(sugary_bev)
miss_plot

#| fig-cap: Number and proportion of missing observations, grouped by site and by variable
miss_table <- sugary_bev %>%
  group_by(Site) %>%
  miss_var_summary() %>%

miss_table %>%
  mutate(pct_miss = paste0(formatC(pct_miss, 2, format = "f"), "%")) %>%
